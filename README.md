## Backend

### Install

#### Install Node JS

Download Node JS from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). If you are using MacOS or a Linux Distribution we recommend to use the package manager. The required commands can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). The installation ships with the **node binaries** and the **node package manager** (npm).

#### Download Dependencies

Before you can start the server you have to install the required dependencies. You can imagine the dependencies as packages in Python or R. The packages can be installed using npm. npm is similar to Python's package manager pip. Use the following command to install the dependencies. 

:warning: **You have to enter the backend folder first to execute the command.** 

```
npm install
```

The command accesses the `package.json` and installs all packages that are listed under `dependencies` and `devDependencies`. The packages are downloaded and saved in the `node_modules` folder.
